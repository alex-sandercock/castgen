Description: Estimate sample sizes needed to capture target levels of
    genetic diversity from a population (multivariate allele frequencies)
    for applications like germplasm conservation and breeding efforts.
    Compares bootstrap samples to a full population using linear
    regression, employing the R-squared value to represent the proportion
    of diversity captured. Iteratively increases sample size until a
    user-defined target R-squared is met. Offers a parallelized R
    implementation of a previously developed Python method. All ploidy
    levels are supported.
